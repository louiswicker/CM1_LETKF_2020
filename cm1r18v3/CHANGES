 CM1 Numerical Model, release 18.3  (cm1r18.3):
 7 October 2015

 Summary of changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  New options/features.

 - Added the horizontal momentum forcing scheme from Morrison et al 
   (2015, JAS, pg 315) as an initialization option.  See iinit = 10 in 
   README.namelist and init3d.F for more information.

 - Added the Revised Surface Layer scheme from WRF.  See Jimenez et al, 
   2012, MWR, pg 898.  Set sfcmodel = 3 to use this scheme. 

 - Restart files can now be written in netcdf format.  See new option 
   "restart_format" in namelist.input, and see README.namelist for more
   information.  (By default, unformatted binary files remain the 
   default format for restart files.) 

 - The default option for restart files is now to write only one file
   (as opposed to one file per node, which was the default in cm1r17).
   [The previous option is still available as restart_filetype = 2]
   One consequence of this new option is that users can change the number 
   of processors on a restart (if desired). 

 - Added the option to integrate the compressible-Boussinesq equation 
   set.  (psolver=6)  This equation set produces similar results to
   the incompressible equations, but permits acoustic waves, and thus can
   be solved with a split-explicit integration scheme.  [See, eg, Bryan 
   and Rotunno, 2014, JAS, pg 1126 for more information.]

 - Added an option to enforce conservation of total dry-air mass by 
   adjusting the average perturbation pressure.  Only needed for long 
   (several day) simulations.  See "apmasscon" option in README.namelist
   for more information.

 - Added a namelist option called "run_time".  When this variable is a 
   positive number, the setting for total model integration time (timax)
   is ignored, and the model with integrate for run_time seconds from the
   current time.  This option can be useful for model restarts. 

 - Changed the formulation of the horizontal turbulence length scale in 
   iturb=3 (the "parameterized turbulence" scheme) over oceans.  Instead 
   of a constant value (l_h), the turbulence lengthscale varies linearly 
   with surface pressure.  Two new namelist variables (lhref1 and lhref2) 
   can be used to define this linear relationship.  This new formulation 
   is useful for reducing horizontal diffusion for ordinary convection 
   over oceans, but allowing for larger lengthscales near the inner-core
   of strong hurricanes.

 - Made a major change to the split-explicit solvers (psolver=2,3).
   The 1d base-state profiles are no longer used for vertical advection
   tendencies;  instead, the 3d fields of theta and pi from the most
   recent RK step are used for 3d advection on small steps (following
   Klemp et al, 2007, MWR, pg 2901).  This change addresses a few 
   minor problems (especially for near-surface profiles with terrain) 
   and reduces artificial diffusion for some cases. 

 - Related to the previous change, code has been added to calculate 
   average velocity over the small time steps.   These fields are then 
   used to advect moisture and passive tracers, and to integrate 
   parcels.  These changes reduce some negative impacts of acoustic waves,
   especially for parcel trajectory calculations. 

 - New output variables:

       2D:  - Surface pressure (psfc).  
              (Note:  this is different from pressure at the lowest 
              model level, which is located at +dz/2 above the surface.)
              (see output_psfc in namelist.input)

       3D:  - Potential vorticity (dry formulation).
              (see output_pv in namelist.input)

            - Dissipative heating tendency.
              (see output_dissheat in namelist.input)

            - Potential-temperature tendency from microphysics scheme.
              (see output_mptend in namelist.input)

            - Fall velocities of hydrometeors.
              (see output_fallvel in namelist.input)

       stats:  - Max/Min surface pressure (psfcmax,psfcmin).
              (Note:  this is different from pressure at the lowest 
              model level, which is located at +dz/2 above the surface.)

 - Users can now choose what variables to output along parcel trajectories 
   (for iprcl=1).  See param13 section of namelist.input and README.namelist 
   for more information.  


   -------------------
    cm1r18.2:

 - Added the ability to write additional variables to restart files.  This
   capability is important for some applications (like ensemble data
   assimilation systems) that make use of variables like reflectivity and
   diabatic heating tendency.  
   [Note:  this capability was added to cm1r18.1, but modified in cm1r18.2 
    to use variables from namelist.input]

 - New output variables:

            - Water vapor mixing ratio of surface (i.e., land/ocean)


   -------------------
    cm1r18.3:

 - For netcdf files (both output files and restart files) several "global"
   variables have been added, such as boundary-condition settings, physics 
   scheme settings, Coriolis parameter, and several parameters entered by 
   users in namelist.input.  (Note:  does not change results, but added for 
   informative purposes.)

 - Several new variables are now available in the param9 section of 
   namelist.input related to restarts.  See README.namelist for more 
   information (note variable names that begin with "restart_").

 - For netcdf-format restart files (restart_format=2), added the ability to
   write only one restart file (that can have many time levels within it). 
   This option is now restart_filetype=1.  The previously available option 
   (one restart file per restart time) is still available as 
   restart_filetype=2.



-------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Changes, fixes, modifications, etc.

 - Fixed a major bug with the CM1 surface flux scheme (sfcmodel=1) when 
   using terrain.  The code previously utilized height above sea level, 
   rather than the height above ground level.  (No change in results for
   simulations without terrain.)  Many thanks to Stefano Serafin (University
   of Vienna) and his collaborators for finding this bug. 
   (sfcphys.F, turb.F)

 - For subgrid turbulence schemes (iturb=1,2,3), the vertically implicit 
   solver is now used at all grid points for all simulations.  The code was 
   also modified to increase performance, and reduce memory usage. 
   (turb.F)

 - Added extra documentation to subgrid turbulence code.  Moved some 
   calculations for readability. 
   (turb.F)

 - The writeout routines for MPI runs have been completely re-written. 
   Three-dimensional output (with output_filetype=1,2) is now much more 
   efficient for simulations with several thousand processors.
   (writeout.F)

 - Made some changes in the primary cm1 solver to reduce roundoff error
   for calculation of pressure tendencies.  Leads to better mass conservation.
   (solve.F)

 - Upgraded the solver for the parcel driver from Euler-forward to 
   second-order Runge-Kutta.  
   (parcel.F)

 - For simulations with semi-slip lower boundary condition (bbc=3), the 
   parcel code now utilizes the log-layer equations for parcels than are 
   between the surface and the lowest half-level. 
   (parcel.F)

 - Fixed various bugs wrt array out-of-bounds problems for simulations 
   without moisture, and simulations with shallow (< 5 km) domains.
   (misclibs.F, turb.F)

 - For the Morrison microphysics scheme, code has been added to 
   include "EVPMS" and "EVPMG" (evaporation of metlted hail and 
   melted graupel/hail) to the evaporation rate in stats output.
   Does not change results;  only changes "tevar" output variable.
   (morrison.F)

 - Fixed a problem with output of theta and qv fluxes at surface when 
   using a PBL scheme.  Thanks to Chris Davis for pointing out this
   error.  
   (turb.F)

 - Fixed a bug with the YSU scheme that was introduced in cm1r17. 
   (An incorrect surface-layer variable was being passed into ysu.F)
   (turb.F)

 - Fixed a bug in which vertical eddy viscosities were not always 
   written correctly when using a PBL scheme. 
   (turb.F)

 - Fixed some very minor bugs in the diff2 subroutines (used for DNS). 
   Thanks to Dave Nolan and Nathan Dahl (U. Miami) for helping flush out 
   these bugs.
   (diff2.F)

 - Updated the Morrison microphysics scheme.  See documentation near the 
   top of the morrison.F file for more information.  Thanks to Hugh Morrison 
   of NCAR.
   (morrison.F)

 - Updated the NSSL microphysics scheme.  Thanks to Ted Mansell of 
   NOAA/NSSL.
   (module_mp_nssl_2mom.F)

 - Updated the surface layer and YSU schemes.  Versions are now from 
   WRF 3.7. 
   (sfclay.F, sfclayrev.F, ysu.F)

 - Made some improvements to speed up MPI communication.
   (comm.F, solve.F, sound.F, pdef.F, parcel.F, etc)

 - Made several changes to the adaptive timestepping scheme to increase 
   peformance and stability.  
   (solve.F, misclibs.F)

 - Made a minor modification to the calculation of dissipative heating 
   near the surface. 
   (turb.F, solve.F)

 - Fixed dissipative heating for iturb=2,3 (which was only being calculated
   at the lowest model level in cm1r17). 
   (turb.F)

 - Radiative tendency output (lwten,swten) have been changed from temperature 
   tendencies to potential-temperature tendencies. 
   (writeout.F)

 - Miscellaneous bug fixes, clarifications, and improvements.
   (nearly all files)

   -------------------
    cm1r18.1:

 - Fixed an error with the calculation of radiative temperature tendencies
   that was introduced in cm1r17.  Thanks to Marty Singh and Hamish Ramsay.
   (solve.F, radtrns3d.F)

   -------------------
    cm1r18.2:

 - Fixed an error with the calculation of surface temperature over land.
   The code now properly accounts for surface albedo, and results in much 
   lower surface temperatures when surface albedo is large.  (Does not 
   affect ocean/water surfaces, and has a small effect on land surfaces 
   with low albedo.)  Thanks to Teddie Keller and Bob Sharman of NCAR/RAL
   for pointing out this error. 
   (turb.F)

   -------------------
    cm1r18.3:

 - Fixed a bug for restarts with adaptive timestepping and ptype=2 or ptype=4.
   (Thanks to Luke Madaus of Univ Washington.)
   (cm1.F)

 - Fixed a bug for restarts when using open lateral boundary conditions and 
   either nodex=1 or nodey=1.  (Thanks to Johnny Hendricks of NCAR/CISL.)

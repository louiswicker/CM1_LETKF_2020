! IMPORTANT: Best results are attained using the new 5th-order WENO advection option (4) for scalars:
! moist_adv_opt                       = 4,
! scalar_adv_opt                      = 4,
! (WENO = Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory)
!
! This module provides a 2-moment bulk microphysics scheme originally 
! developed by Conrad Ziegler (Zeigler, 1985, JAS) and modified/upgraded in 
! in Mansell, Zeigler, and Bruning (2010, JAS).  Two-moment adaptive sedimentation 
! follows Mansell (2010, JAS), using parameter infall = 4.
!
! Added info on graupel density and soaking is in Mansell and Ziegler (2013, JAS)
!
! Average graupel particle density is predicted, which affects fall speed as well. 
! Hail density prediction is by default disabled in this version, but may be enabled
! at some point if there is interest.

!PRO RF_SPEC ; Computes Radar Reflectivity
!COMMON MAINB, data, x1d, y1d, z1d, iconst, rconst, labels, nx, ny, nz, dshft
!
!;MODIFICATION HISTORY
!; 5/99  -Svelta Veleva introduces variable dielf (const_ki_x) as a (weak)
!;   function of density.  This leads to slight modification of dielf such
!;   that the snow reflectivity is slightly increased - not a big effect.
!;   This is believed to be more accurate than assuming the dielectric
!;   constant for snow is the same as for hail in previous versions.
!
!;On 6/13/99 I added the VIL computation (k=0 in vil array)
!;On 6/15/99 I removed the number concentration dependencies as a function
!;           of temperature (only use for ferrier!)
!;On 6/15/99 I added the Composite reflectivity (k=1 in VIL array)
!;On 6/15/99 I added the Severe Hail Index computation (k=2 in vil array)
!;
!; 6/99 - Veleva and Seo argue that since graupel is more similar to
!;   snow (in number conc and size density) than it is to hail, we
!;   should not weight wetted graupel with the .95 exponent correction
!;   factor as in the case of hail.  An if-statement checks the size
!;   density for wet hail/graupel and treats them appropriately.
!;
!; 6/22/99 - Added function to compute height of max rf and 40 dbz echo top
!;           Also added vilqr which is the model vertical integrated liquid only
!;           using qr.  Will need to check...doesn't seem consistent with vilZ

!
! Things to do:
!
!  Test using exponential formulation for rain fall speed.  If there is little change
!  from the quadratic, it would be less complicated to use.
!
!  Contact nucleation needs to be fixed up to be similar to Cotton et al. 1986 and Meyers et al 1992.
!
! The following are done?
!
!  Fix Rain evaporation for gamma function (ipconc >= 3)
!
!  convert cloud ice to snow as in Ferrier 1994 (change only mass in cloud ice),
!    then can try turning off direct conversion from cloud ice to graupel and rimed ice
!
!  look at an iterative check on overdepletion;  need to be careful with two-moment
!
!  check ice supersaturation in two-moment.  Getting enough deposition, or need 
!      to do sat adj. when cloud droplets are all gone?
!
!  
!
! new comment
!
! Fix use of gt for SWM IN FALLOUT ROUTINES
!
!  How to remove hl for ipconc=5?  Need to preprocess?
!
!   When the charging rates are moved to a subroutine, need to move the
!   call to be after the wet growth calculations -- or at least the 
!   splashing stuff.  Think about this....
!
!  Think about what to do with cracif
!
!    Replace qv0 with qx(mgs,lv)? No. qv0 is base val
!
! Need to look at limiting supersaturation to 1 or so by nucleation/condensation
!
!  put in temperature-dependent function for homogeneous freezing

!
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
! Notes:
!
!  4/27/2009: allows for liquid water to be advected on snow and graupel particles using flag "mixedphase"
!
!  3/14/2007: (APS) added qproc temp to make microphysic process timeseries
!
!  10/17/2006: added flag (iehw) to select how to calculate ehw
!
!  10/5/2006: switched chacr to integrated version rather than assuming that average rain
!             drop mass does not change.  This acts to reduce rain size somewhat via graupel
!             collection.
!             Use Mason data for ehw, with scaling toward ehw=1 as air density decreases.
!
!  10/3/2006: Turned off Meyers nucleation for T > -5 (can turn on with imeyers5 flag)
!             Turned off contact nucleation in updrafts
!
!  7/24/2006:  Turned on Meyers nucleation for -5 < T < 0
!
!  5/12/2006:  Converted qsacw/csacw and qsaci/csaci to Z93
!
!  5/12/2006:  Put a threshold on Bigg rain freezing.  If the frozen drops
!              have an average volume less than xvhmn, then the drops are put
!              into snow instead of graupel/hail.
!
!              Fixed bug when vapor deposition was limited.
!
!  5/13/2006:  Note that qhacr has a large effect, but Z85 did not include it.
!              Turned off qsacr (set to zero).
!
!  9/14/2007: erm: recalculate vx(lh) after setting xdn(lh) in case xdn was out of allowed range.
!             added parameter rimc3 for minimum rime density.  Default value set at 170. kg/m**3
!             instead of previous use of 100.  (Farley, 1987)
